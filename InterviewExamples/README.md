# InterviewExamples

This repository contains a collection of small, focused .NET/C# code examples that cover common coding interview topics and technical fundamentals.

## üéØ Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Practice real-world interview questions in C#/.NET
- Explore important programming concepts
- Improve code readability and structuring
- Improve code-reading ability 
- Build confidence for mid/senior-level .NET interviews

Each example is written in its own class with a dedicated `Run()` method and can be launched individually from the main menu in `Program.cs`.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run/Train with this repo

1. Clone the Repo
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio: `InterviewExamples.sln`
1. Set `InterviewExamples` as the startup project.
1. Choose an example class to practice.
1. Read the class and think about the solution. What will the class print/do in it's Run()?
1. Run the app (`F5` or `Ctrl + F5`).
1. Choose the number of the example you analyzed and compare with your solution. Is it the same?

## üìÇ Structure

- `InterviewExamples/Examples/` ‚Äì All example classes, each demonstrating a specific concept.
- `Program.cs` ‚Äì Main entry point with a switch menu to launch any example.
- `KeyboardShortcuts.md` ‚Äì My personal list of useful Visual Studio and C# shortcuts.

## üìå Current Examples
